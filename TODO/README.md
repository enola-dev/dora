# TODOs as RDF

<!-- TODO: Actually implement the ToDo tool... ;-) -->

This explores extracting `TODO`s from files (MD or any other) as RDF Triples.

They can then be rendered e.g. to a MD with links to all of them, classified by some #tags categories, and represented visually as a graph!

<!-- TODO: How to link to specific lines? GitHub uses #L18,
           but RFC 5147 for TXT suggested #line=3 ... -->
